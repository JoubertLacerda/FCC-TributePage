                <li>In <strong>1999</strong> Elon Musk makes $22M from 'Zip2' sale, later that year Elon starts his own
                    bank, X.com, with his own money. In that same year, he suffers a car accident in his McLaren F1 that
                    he bought for a cool $1M, All while competing
                    for customers with another startup banking company called 'Confinity'</li>
                <li>The year <strong>2000</strong> was a busy year for Elon Musk. 'Confinity' and 'X.com' merge to form
                    'PayPal', Elon marries College girlfriend Justine, Gets dropped as CEO of PayPal while on his
                    honeymoon but still decides to invest on it, almost

                <li>In <strong>2002</strong> he realised that rockets prices are artificially inflated after failing to
                    negotiate a purchase of a rocket from the Russians. Decides to start a company to build his own
                    rockets, using his own money, and calles it 'SpaceX'.
                    Later that year PayPal is sold and Elon Musk makes a cool $180M and begins to think about investing
                    in Electric car.</li>
                <li><strong>2004</strong> he invests on the company called Telsa</li>
                <li><strong>2006</strong> was a series of ups and downs for SpaceX. The first ever rocket they built
                    crashes, later that year SpaceX secures contracts to demo cargo delivery to the ISS space station
                    from NASA and make the 'Falcon 9' rocket delivery
                    system. Elon Musk also becomes the 1st investor on a company called 'Solar City'.</li>
                <li>Between <strong>2007-2008</strong> the 2nd and 3rd rocket launch fails destroying 3 satellites, one
                    of which belonged to NASA. Tesla delivers the first Roadster which has the price tag of $109,000.
                    But both Tesla and SpaceX are low on funds at
                    this stage, luckly the 4th launch from SpaceX is successful which leads to a contract with NASA for
                    12 flights for wopping $1.2B saving the company from collapse. Speaking of close calls, just hours
                    before Tesla goes bankrupt, he manages to
                    secure funding for the company.</li>
                <li><strong>2010</strong> buys car company for cheap from Toyota.</li>
                <li>In <strong>2011</strong> he promises the world that he would take Humanity to Mars by 2021-2031 and
                    annouces reusable rockets which would bring the cost of space flight down making it 100 times
                    cheaper.</li>
                <li>The years <strong>2012 and 2014</strong>, Elon Musk reviels the Model X, Teslas first SUV range, the
                    'Dragon' docks with the ISS space station and the Model S starts shipping at $75,000. SpaceX begins
                    trials on landing rockets from low altitude
                    and later begin trials from Orbit onto barges at sea.</li>
                <li>At this stage its safe to say that Elon Musk in on a roll! In <strong>2015</strong> SpaceX succeeds
                    in landing upright making it the FIRST reusable rocket,<strong> 2017</strong> he begins working on
                    the 'BFR' Rocket (Big Fucking Rocket) that works
                    on cheap methane fuel, start the 'Boring'company to make tunnels.</li>
                <li><strong>2017</strong> he unveils Tesla first electric truck and the new Roadster capable of
                    accelerating from 0 to 60mph in 1.9 seconds, the Model 3 also begins to ship with a price tag of
                    $35,000 </li>
